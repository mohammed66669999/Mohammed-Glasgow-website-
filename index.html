    <h1>Glasgow: A City Full of Character</h1>

    <p>

      Glasgow is one of my favourite cities because it has a unique mix of

      history, culture, and friendly people. The city is known for its beautiful

      Victorian architecture, lively music scene, and welcoming atmosphere.

      Whether you are walking through the busy streets of the city centre or

      relaxing by the River Clyde, Glasgow always feels full of energy.

      I love exploring different parts of the city. The West End has amazing

      cafés, vintage shops, and the stunning University of Glasgow. The city

      also has many green parks, like Kelvingrove Park and Glasgow Green,

      where people go to walk, run, or just enjoy the fresh air. Glasgow is

      also famous for its museums, most of which are free to visit.
